#+TITLE: Cetus

Cetus is a wallpaper manager written in Go. It uses [[https://source.unsplash.com/][Unsplash Source]] to get
wallpapers.

*Note*: Cetus is a work in-progress & many features are yet to be implemented.

* Uses
- on system startup for new wallpaper at every startup
- as a cron job to change wallpaper at set intervals
* Demo
I just run some cetus commands on my computer, nothing fancy. I'll make better
demo videos someday.
