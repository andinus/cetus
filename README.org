#+TITLE: Cetus

Cetus is a simple wallpaper management tool written in Go. It supports multiple
sources for fetching the background.

*Note*: Cetus is a work in-progress & many features are yet to be implemented.

*Dependency*: [[https://feh.finalrewind.org/][feh]]

* Demo
I just run some cetus commands on my computer, nothing fancy. I'll make better
demo videos someday.

*Note*: Cetus was restructured multiple times & these demos may not work on the
latest release.
